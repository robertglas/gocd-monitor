# Go cd monitor
Build monitor for Go cd build server https://www.go.cd/

Robert Glas Fork: Trying to add Behave test result compatibility (currently it's only compatible with Cucumber JSON test result format).

#### Pipeline status
* Blue - Pipeline is building
* Green - Pipeline build passed
* Red - Pipeline has failed
* Yellow - Pipeline has been paused

## Setup
Open app-config.js and change the three lines
```   
// Url for your go server
goServerUrl: 'https://ci.example.com',
// Go user to use for communication with go server
goUser: 'xxx',
// Password for go user
goPassword: 'xxx',
  ```
Open a terminal and enter
```
npm install
npm start
```
Go to `http://localhost:3000`

Enjoy :)

## Configuration
Go to `http://localhost:3000?admin` and click the settings button in the bottom-right corner to open the configuration dialog.
* Sort Order - Sort pipelines by status or latest build time
* Filter Pipelines - Disable/enable pipelines to retrieve from go server

## Test reports
To configure test reports, go to `http://localhost:3000/test-results?admin`. Click the '+'-button and choose the pipeline you want to generate test reports for. The system then retrieves all test files and creates graph and possible error table for all tests found in that pipeline. For now only cucumber tests are supported. If defined, the system will switch between monitor and test report page every `switchBetweenPagesInterval` seconds.

## How it works
The server polls the go server every `goPollingInterval` seconds. The results are then reported to the client using [socket.io](http://socket.io/). The pipelines and its pause info are refreshed once every day.

## Development
To run the application in development mode, open a terminal and enter `npm run dev-start`. The server and client will be rebuilt when a js or jsx-file changes.
To run tests, enter `npm test`.
